'''Assignment 1: Time Converter
========================================

An event management company is developing a scheduling system. One of the key tasks is converting the duration of events from total seconds (which their sensor system records) into a more human-readable format of hours, minutes, and seconds.

Write a Python program that:
- Accepts the total event duration in seconds as input.
- Calculates how many hours, minutes, and seconds it corresponds to.
- Displays the output in the format:
  Hours: x, Minutes: y, Seconds: z

Sample Input:
Total event duration in seconds: 3672

Sample Output:
Hours: 1, Minutes: 1, Seconds: 12'''


seconds = int(input("Total event duration in seconds: "))
hour = seconds//3600
min = seconds%3600
minutes = min//60
second = min%60
print(f"Hours: {hour}, Minutes: {minutes},Seconds:{second}")
