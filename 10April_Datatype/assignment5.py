Assignment 5: Shopping Tax Calculator
========================================

Your shopping cart total doesn’t include tax. A 12% GST is applied.

Write a Python program that:
- Accepts the cart total amount.
- Calculates 12% tax.
- Displays the tax and final total amount.

Example:
Cart = ₹2000
Tax = ₹240
Total = ₹2240
'''

total = int(input("Enter the total amount : "))
tax = (total/100)*12
print(f"Cart = ₹{total}\nTax = ₹{tax}\nTotal = ₹{total+tax}")
