Calendar System – Leap Year Checker
A digital calendar system needs to check whether a year is a leap year.
A year is a leap year if:

It is divisible by 400, OR
It is divisible by 4 but not by 100
Write a program using inline if to display whether the year is a leap year or not.

n = int(input("Enter the year : "))

print("Leap year" if(n%400==0 or n%4==0 and n%100!=0) else "Normal year")
