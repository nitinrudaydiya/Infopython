Lift Mode Operation – Advanced Smart Elevator System

A smart building elevator works in multiple intelligent modes based on the mode number entered by the control panel.  
The system must automatically execute floor movement instructions using loops.

Write a program:

- If mode = 1  
  Normal Up Mode activated.  
  Read current floor and destination floor.  
  Print all floors from current to destination in ascending order.

- Else if mode = 2  
  Down Mode activated.  
  Read current floor and destination floor.  
  Print all floors from current to destination in descending order.

- Else if mode = 3  
  Energy Saving Mode activated.  
  Read destination floor.  
  Lift starts from ground floor (0) and stops only on alternate floors till destination.

- Else  
  Emergency Mode activated.  
  Print "Emergency Alarm" 4 times using loop.
